Since I started programming, I came across a fair amount of IDEs, but <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">Repl.it</a> was profound in developing my passion in programming. I would spend hours after school fiddling around with what Repl.it offered.  Before I present my review, allow me to disuss the features Repl.it has to offer.
<br><br>
Repl.it is an in-browser IDE that promotes both beginner and professional programming. Repl.it's IDE promotes beginners as it offers:<br>
- VSCode intelligence, which offers parameter hinting, autoformatting of code, definition jumping, and additional features listed <a href="https://blog.repl.it/intel" target=”_blank”>here</a><br>
- A simple file manager <br>
- An additional command line interface<br>
- Example code when creating new files<br>
- A run button simplifying the compilation/interpretation/execution process<br><br>

Repl.it's IDE also promotes professionals, as it offers:<br>
- A personal virtual machine<br>
- Database environment for each project<br>
- A large selection of packages<br>
- Github integration<br>
- Support for over 50 languages<br>
- A feature called Multiplayer, a feature to code with a team on the same file<br><br>

In addition, Repl.it offers a community of developers, as the site has a developer platform. The platform offers:<br>
- A developer forum<br>
- Several project templates<br>
- A large selection of programming tutorial pages<br>
- Community lead classroom environments<br>
- Online code jams that challenge developers to create projects based on given themes. Prizes include from cryptocurrency, money, or temporary free access to the Hacker plan, a plan that will be discussed later in the review.<br><br>

The paid account version that Repl.it offers is the Hacker plan. Before I delve into what the Hacker plan offers, I must discuss the Starter plan, Repl.it's free plan tier. Aside from what has already been mentioned, the Starter plan offers:<br>
- 500 MB storage<br>
- 500 MB memory<br>
- 0.2 - 0.5 vCPUs<br><br>

The Hacker plan offers:<br>
- 5 GB of storage<br>
- 2 GB of memory<br>
- 2 vCPUs<br>
- Private projects.<br><br>

With context of Repl.it's features given, I rate Repl.it an <b>9/10</b>.<br><br>

I truly enjoy how Repl.it offers many features geared towards both beginner and professional niches of programming. Repl.it is also maintained by a tightly knit, dedicated group of developers, which is another plus, as it results in a much more stable platform. I also believe that Repl.it is a wonderful platform to use when trying out a new language, as the site offers both language support and tutorials of a great deal of languages. In addition, Repl.it's online IDE makes it convenient for developers programming on various computers and operating systems. Overall, Repl.it makes programming convenient and productive. Repl.it is encourages productivity to the point that I finished my sophmore year computer science curriculum a half-semester early by doing all my homework and projects there! I also plan on using Multiplayer on Repl.it a whole lot in the near future. Multiplayer makes programming is small groups extremely convenient, especially with the ongoing pandemic keeping us indoors.<br><br>

One small downside I have as a hobbyist mobile app developer is how there are few options for developing on mobile. While React Native is offered on Repl.it, which is awesome, I still have a lot of personal preference to Java for Android Studio and C# for Visual Studio. I would love to try out more ways of building mobile apps on Repl.it, as that would add on to the high level of convenience Repl.it offers!<br><br>

In conclusion, Repl.it deserves an <b>9/10</b>. If you create mobile apps, you can still use React Native, but developers used to Android Studio and Visual Studio will have not a Repl.it alternative. If you want to try out a new language, host a website, or code in real time, Repl.it is the best IDE for you. <br><br>
