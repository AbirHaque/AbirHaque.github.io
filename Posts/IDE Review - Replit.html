Since I started programming, I came across a fair amount of IDEs, but <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">Repl.it</a> was profound in developing my passion in programming. I would spend hours after school fiddling around with what Repl.it offered.  Before I present my review, allow me to disuss the features Repl.it has to offer.
<br><br>
Repl.it is an in-browser IDE that promotes both beginner and professional programming. Repl.it's IDE promotes beginners as it offers:<br>
- VSCode intelligence, which offers parameter hinting, autoformatting of code, definition jumping, and additional features listed <a href="https://blog.repl.it/intel" target=”_blank”>here</a><br>
- A simple file manager <br>
- An additional command line interface<br>
- Example code when creating new files<br>
- A run button simplifying the compilation/interpretation/execution process<br><br>

Repl.it's IDE also promotes professionals, as it offers:<br>
- A personal virtual machine<br>
- Database environment for each project<br>
- A large selection of packages<br>
- Github integration<br>
- Support for over 50 languages<br>
- A feature called Multiplayer, a feature to code with a team on the same file<br><br>

In addition, Repl.it offers a community of developers, as the site has a developer platform. The platform offers:<br>
- A developer forum<br>
- Several project templates<br>
- A large selection of programming tutorial pages<br>
- Community lead classroom environments<br>
- Online code jams that challenge developers to create projects based on given themes. Prizes include from cryptocurrency, money, or temporary free access to the Hacker plan, a plan that will be discussed later in the review.<br><br>

The paid account version that Repl.it offers is the Hacker plan. Before I delve into what the Hacker plan offers, I must discuss the Starter plan, Repl.it's free plan tier. Aside from what has already been mentioned, the Starter plan offers:<br>
- 500 MB storage<br>
- 500 MB memory<br>
- 0.2 - 0.5 vCPUs<br><br>

The Hacker plan offers:<br>
- 5 GB of storage<br>
- 2 GB of memory<br>
- 2 vCPUs<br>
- Private projects.<br><br>

With context of Repl.it's features given, I rate Repl.it an <b>8/10</b>.<br><br>

I truly enjoy how Repl.it offers many features geared towards both beginner and professional niches of programming. Repl.it is also maintained by a tightly knit, dedicated group of developers, which is another plus, as it results in a much more stable platform. I also believe that Repl.it is a wonderful platform to use when trying out a new language, as the site offers both language support and tutorials of a great deal of languages. In addition, Repl.it's online IDE makes it convenient for developers programming on various computers and operating systems. Overall, Repl.it makes programming convenient and productive. Repl.it is encourages productivity to the point that I finished my sophmore year computer science curriculum a half-semester early by doing all my homework and projects there! I also plan on using Multiplayer on Repl.it a whole lot in the near future. Multiplayer makes programming is small groups extremely convenient, especially with the ongoing pandemic keeping us indoors.<br><br>

One major downside of Repl.it is its offline incapability, which tackles my argument of Repl.it being convenient. However, the Repl.it developer team is working on getting offline support soon, which certainly deserves high praise! A slight downside is the little storage space and memory offered by the Starter plan. I call this a slight downside as system resource usage limitations are not going to be a problem for developers merely trying out languages. Developers intending to use Repl.it to build large applications should look to the Hacker plan. Repl.it, overall, is not great for developers needing large amounts of system resources, which is the main reason why I use Repl.it a bit less than I used to.<br><br>

In conclusion, Repl.it deserves an <b>8/10</b> as it offers online convenience at the expense of limited system resources and no offline support. If you want to try out a new language, host a small website, or code in real time, Repl.it is the best IDE for you. If you need large amounts of system resources for you next project, Repl.it is not the place for you.<br><br>
