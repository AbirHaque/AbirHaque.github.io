			<h2 class="text-center">Selected Projects</h2>
			<p>I work on multiple projects in addition to my required computer science coursework. Many
				are direct results of my explorations in my research interests. The
				following are select projects I am extremely proud of & have made decent progress:</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>MuseEQ Suite</h3><img src="https://abirhaque.github.io/Images/MuseEQ.png" width="100%"><br>
					<p>This is an <b>award-winning</b> project for Hack K-State 2022, a 36-hour hackathon that occured November
						2022.
						I collaborated within a 3-person team to develop a <b>GTK</b> minimal <b>digital audio workstation</b> (DAW)
						&
						full-stack React Native mobile app. The novelty of this project includes timbres being user-defined
						equations parsed by our implementation of <b>Dijkstra’s Shunting Yard algorithm</b>. Audio mixing is
						<b>multithreaded</b> with Python’s Threading module. This project won Best Use of
						AppWrite, a self-hosted, no-code back-end solution.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Sentinel IoT Camera</h3><img src="https://abirhaque.github.io/Images/Sentinel.jpg" width="100%"><br>
					<p>This project involves developing the <b>ESP32-CAM microcontroller</b> to securely connect to network by
						receiving credentials via HTTPS. The novelty of this project includes <b>managing device certificates</b>
						with a
						<b>Node.js REST API</b>. End users receive the device certificate by scanning the device’s QR code, which
						contains the certificate’s GET request link. This project is inspired by Bitdefender white paper titled
						<b><i><a
									href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221223080636/https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/294/Bitdefender-WhitePaper-RDoor-CREA3949-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf"
									target="_blank">Ring Video Doorbell Pro Under the Scope</a></i></b>,
						which outlines a vulnerability that allows an
						attacker to <b>intercept device owner’s network credentials</b>. This is an <b>ongoing project</b> that
						began August 2022.

					<h3>Pineapple Math</h3><img
						src="https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/899/375/datas/medium.png"
						width="50%"><br>
					<p>This is an <b>award-winning</b> project for Hack KU 2022, a 36-hour hackathon that occured April 2022.
						I collaborated within a 4-person team to develop a <b>full-stack</b> web app with Node.js, Express.js, &
						MongoDB. This app helps students learn math, allows teachers to post assignments, & animates word problems.
						Project won 1st place in the Education Themed Track & Best Use of GitHub.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Interfere Free Calc</h3><img src="https://abirhaque.github.io/Images/Interfere/png2.png" width="100%"><br>
					<p>This project is a minimal audio player & visualizer for mathematical equations. This project entirely
						developed in Java.
						Development lasted from March 2021 to August 2021.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Interfere Cascade</h3><img src="https://abirhaque.github.io/Images/Interfere/png1.png" width="100%"><br>
					<p>This project is a MIDI tracker that I worked on during the senior year of high school. This project was
						inspired by my interest in retro computer music.
						What makes this project unique is how users can display notes in the command line with specified colors for
						the note text & background at a given timestep.
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9ghuxvqTA" target="_blank">
							Here is a short song I composed entirely with Cascade that best exhibits this feature!</a> The editor was
						entirely developed in Java.
						Development lasted from October 2020 to August 2021.
