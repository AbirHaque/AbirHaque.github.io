	<dd>Below are a few of my projects that deviate from my school's CS curriculum.</dd>
<br>
	<dd><img src="Images/ScreenGiffer_gifs/gif1.gif" width="40%"><br> <b>ScreenGiffer: </b><a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/ScreenGiffer" target="_blank">Code</a><br>
Project development started since early August as a quick weekend project. ScreenGiffer captures your screen into a GIF file. Read more about this project <a href="https://abirhaque.github.io/Posts/Projects%20-%20ScreenGiffer.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</dd>

	<dd><img src="Images/Tallia/ic_launcher.png" width="10%"><br><b>Tallia: </b><a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/Tallia/releases/tag/1.1.1" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/Tallia" target="_blank">Code</a><br> Development of this app started since July 2020 and is ongoing. Tallia is being developed in partership with <a href="http://nir-v.github.io/" target="_blank">NIR-V</a>. The app is aimed towards people with mental disabilities. The app's current functionalities include: keeping daily entries of how a user feels, graphing the ups and downs a user has each day, and an optional feature of sending daily entries to a guardian through SMS. This is one of my first collaborative open-source projects, and we will appreciate any GitHub contributions made to <a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/Tallia" target="_blank">Tallia</a>!</dd>

	<dd><img src="Images/SwimDB/gif1.gif" width="40%"><br><b>SwimDB:</b><br> Development of this app started since February 2020 and is ongoing. SwimDB is being developed in partership with Coach Hutchinson of the Wichita East High School Swim Team. The app is aimed towards swim coaches, as the app serves as a swim team manager.  The app's current functionalities include: tracking individual swimmer stats, creating workout sets for up to eight lanes, and automatically adjusting duration and intensity of each workout for individual swimmers. All calculations are based off of an Excel spreadsheet Coach Hutchinson uses to manage his own team. This is by far the most extensive app I have ever worked on as it not only functions on Android and iOS, but also serves as a cumilative test to my technical and theoretical knowledge of CS. With all of that said, I am super happy to work with Coach Hutchinson!</dd>

	<dd><img src="Images/BanglaAlphabetApp/gif1.gif" width="40%"><br><b>Bangla Alphabet App:</b> <a href="https://bangla-alphabet--abirhaque.repl.co/" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://estes.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2205" target="_blank">Press Mention</a><br> Development of this app lasted from September to October 2019. I created the app with two intentions: to have an app that provides interactive Bangla alphabet charts to aide in Bangla literacy and to have a submission for the 2019 KS-04 Congressional App Challenge. While I consider this app to be rudimentary, it was the biggest project I ever completed 
in 2019 and won the challenge.</dd>

	<dd><img src="Images/RedditScraper/gif1.gif" width="40%"><br><b>Top Subbreddit Image Scraper: </b><a href="https://top-subreddit-meme-scraper.abirhaque.repl.run/" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://repl.it/@AbirHaque/Top-Subreddit-Meme-Scraper#README.md" target="_blank">Code</a><br> This console project is one of many laidback weekend projects I do for fun. Development of this project lasted for one weekend in September. It scrapes a Reddit page for the highest upvoted image/meme when given a subreddit and filter, then presents a preview image link to the user. Basically, this is the complicated way to look at memes on Reddit.</dd>
