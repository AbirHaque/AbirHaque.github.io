	<dd>Below are a few of my projects that I have completed or are ongoing: </dd>
<br><br><br><br>
	<dd><br> <b>SimpleWaveManager: </b><a href="https://simplewavemanager.abirhaque.repl.co/" target="_blank">Javadoc</a><br>
	SimpleWaveManager is library I wrote during April 2021. The library is designed to allow mono/stereo audio input/output code to be portable across different Java versions (Java 6 and higher), specifically those without access to JavaX Sound or Android Media libraries. This library is utilized in Interfere Free Calc.

The Interfere Software collection is a series of digital audio editors that I have been working on since October 2020. Interfere Free Calc, a minimal audio player and visualizer for mathematical equations, is the most recent program within this collection. Interfere Cascade, a MIDI composition editor, was the first program. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9ghuxvqTA" target="_blank">Here is a short song I composed entirely with Cascade!</a></dd>

	<dd><img src="Images/CSVOL/desktop_gui.png" width="75%"><br> <b>CSVOL: </b><a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/CSVOL/releases/tag/21_0.0.0" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/CSVOL" target="_blank">Code</a> <a href="https://abirhaque.github.io/csvol-docs" target="_blank">Documentation Page</a><br>
Character Separated Value Organizer Language, or CSVOL (\kasväl\), is programming language created for the <a href="https://blog.repl.it/langjam" target="_blank">2020 Repl.it Programming Language Jam</a>. Development of CSVOL started since August 2020 and ended December 2020.</dd>

	<dd><img src="Images/Tallia/ic_launcher.png" width="20%"><br><b>Tallia: </b><a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/Tallia/releases/tag/1.1.1" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/Tallia" target="_blank">Code</a><br> Development of this app lasted from July 2020 to September 2020. Tallia is was developed in partership with <a href="http://nir-v.github.io/" target="_blank">NIR-V</a>. The app's current functionalities include: keeping daily entries of how a user feels, graphing the ups and downs a user has each day, and an optional feature of sending daily entries to a guardian through SMS.</dd>
        <br><br><br><br>
	<dd><img src="Images/SwimDB/gif1.gif" width="75%"><br><b>SwimDB:</b><br> Development of this app started lasted from February 2020 to August 2020. SwimDB was developed in partership with my high school's swim coach. The app is aimed towards swim coaches, as the app serves as a swim team manager.  The app's current functionalities include: tracking individual swimmer stats, creating workout sets for up to eight lanes, and automatically adjusting duration and intensity of each workout for individual swimmers. All calculations are based off of an Excel spreadsheet my coach uses to manage his own team.</dd>
        <br><br><br><br>
	<dd><img src="Images/BanglaAlphabetApp/gif1.gif" width="75%"><br><b>Bangla Alphabet App:</b> <a href="https://bangla-alphabet--abirhaque.repl.co/" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://estes.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2205" target="_blank">Press Mention</a><br> Development of this app lasted from September to October 2019. I created the app with two intentions: to have an app that provides interactive Bangla alphabet charts to aide in Bangla literacy and to have a submission for the 2019 KS-04 Congressional App Challenge. While I consider this app to be rudimentary, it was the biggest project I ever completed 
in 2019.</dd>

	<dd><img src="Images/RedditScraper/gif1.gif" width="75%"><br><b>Top Subbreddit Image Scraper: </b><a href="https://Top-Subreddit-Image-Scraper.abirhaque.repl.run" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://repl.it/@AbirHaque/Top-Subreddit-Image-Scraper#README.md" target="_blank">Code</a><br> This console project is one of many laidback weekend projects I do for fun. Development of this project lasted for one weekend in September. It scrapes a Reddit page for the highest upvoted image/meme when given a subreddit and filter, then presents a preview image link to the user. This is the complicated way to look at memes on Reddit.</dd>
