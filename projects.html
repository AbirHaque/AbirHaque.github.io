	<dd>Below are a few of my projects that deviate from my school's CS curriculum: </dd>

Character Separated Value Organizer Language, or CSVOL (\kasväl\), is an extensible scripting language designed to interact with online program libraries. CSVOL is intended for programmers, both new and experienced, who don’t want to waste time compiling code for small programs. CSVOL 21 is the newest version of CSVOL. Screenshots of CSVOL 21 are soon to come. Videos on CSVOL 21 and SOL's progress are on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQuF2wjRE-_h5wTmpQ8S-Tw">my YouTube channel </a>. Development of CSVOL started since August 2020 and is ongoing.</dd>

Project development started since early August as a quick weekend project. ScreenGiffer captures your screen into a GIF file. All of the GIFs you see on this website were created with ScreenGiffer.</dd>

	<dd><img src="Images/Tallia/ic_launcher.png" width="20%"><br><b>Tallia: </b><a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/Tallia/releases/tag/1.1.1" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://github.com/AbirHaque/Tallia" target="_blank">Code</a><br> Development of this app lasted from July to September 2020. Tallia is was developed in partership with <a href="http://nir-v.github.io/" target="_blank">NIR-V</a>. The app's current functionalities include: keeping daily entries of how a user feels, graphing the ups and downs a user has each day, and an optional feature of sending daily entries to a guardian through SMS.</dd>
        <br><br><br><br>
	<dd><img src="Images/SwimDB/gif1.gif" width="75%"><br><b>SwimDB:</b><br> Development of this app started lasted from February 2020 to August 2020. SwimDB was developed in partership with my high school's swim coach. The app is aimed towards swim coaches, as the app serves as a swim team manager.  The app's current functionalities include: tracking individual swimmer stats, creating workout sets for up to eight lanes, and automatically adjusting duration and intensity of each workout for individual swimmers. All calculations are based off of an Excel spreadsheet my coach uses to manage his own team.</dd>
        <br><br><br><br>
	<dd><img src="Images/BanglaAlphabetApp/gif1.gif" width="75%"><br><b>Bangla Alphabet App:</b> <a href="https://bangla-alphabet--abirhaque.repl.co/" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://estes.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2205" target="_blank">Press Mention</a><br> Development of this app lasted from September to October 2019. I created the app with two intentions: to have an app that provides interactive Bangla alphabet charts to aide in Bangla literacy and to have a submission for the 2019 KS-04 Congressional App Challenge. While I consider this app to be rudimentary, it was the biggest project I ever completed 
in 2019.</dd>

	<dd><img src="Images/RedditScraper/gif1.gif" width="75%"><br><b>Top Subbreddit Image Scraper: </b><a href="https://Top-Subreddit-Image-Scraper.abirhaque.repl.run" target="_blank">Product</a> <a href="https://repl.it/@AbirHaque/Top-Subreddit-Image-Scraper#README.md" target="_blank">Code</a><br> This console project is one of many laidback weekend projects I do for fun. Development of this project lasted for one weekend in September. It scrapes a Reddit page for the highest upvoted image/meme when given a subreddit and filter, then presents a preview image link to the user. This is the complicated way to look at memes on Reddit.</dd>
